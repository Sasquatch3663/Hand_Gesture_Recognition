# Hand_Gesture_Recognition
This project uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect real-time hand gestures via webcam. It can recognize individual and combined gestures (e.g., Rock, Peace, Thumbs Up) and map finger distance (thumbâ€“index) to system volume using pycaw. The system provides real-time feedback with visual overlays and can detect gestures from one or two hands.
